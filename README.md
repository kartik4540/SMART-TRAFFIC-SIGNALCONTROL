AI-Powered Traffic Signal Management System

Problem Statement

Fixed-timer traffic signals cause unnecessary delays, especially for ambulances and emergency vehicles, risking lives. Existing systems lack dynamic management and accident detection to enhance road safety.

Objective

To develop an AI-powered traffic signal management system that optimizes signal timers in real-time based on vehicle density, ensuring smoother traffic flow and reducing congestion. The system will prioritize ambulances and other emergency vehicles by automatically turning signals green to facilitate faster transit and save lives. Additionally, it aims to incorporate accident detection capabilities in future iterations to further enhance road safety and emergency response efficiency.

Methodology

1. Vehicle Detection Using Computer Vision

Utilize OpenCV and YOLOv8 for detecting vehicles in live traffic scenarios.

Implement pre-trained deep learning models to classify emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire trucks.

Use smart cameras equipped with AI to capture real-time traffic density data.

2. Dynamic Traffic Signal Management

Develop an algorithm to dynamically adjust signal timers based on vehicle density.

Implement a priority mechanism for emergency vehicles:

Identify emergency vehicles through classification models.

Automatically turn signals green for their route.

3. Accident Detection and Alerts

Use AI-powered image and video analytics to detect anomalies indicating accidents.

Integrate sensors and smart cameras for enhanced detection accuracy.

Develop a system to send automated alerts to nearby emergency services and traffic management teams.

4. Data Handling and IoT Integration

Employ smart cameras to capture and process real-time traffic data.

Utilize cloud storage for maintaining historical traffic data and accident records.

Develop Python-based APIs for seamless integration with existing traffic management systems.

Ensure secure data handling and compliance with privacy regulations.

5. System Testing and Deployment

Perform rigorous testing in simulated traffic environments to ensure system accuracy and reliability.

Gradually deploy the system in real-world traffic scenarios, starting with small-scale trials before scaling to larger areas.

Collect feedback from traffic authorities and emergency response teams to refine the system.
